I recently purchased the Hydro Flask Standard Mouth Bottle with Flex Cap, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This water bottle has quickly become my go-to for staying hydrated on the go.


First and foremost, the quality of the Hydro Flask bottle is exceptional. The stainless steel construction feels incredibly durable, and I have no doubt that this bottle will last for a long time. The double-wall vacuum insulation keeps my drinks cold for hours, which is perfect for those hot summer days or intense workouts.


The standard mouth size is just right for sipping or pouring without any spills. The flex cap is easy to open and close, and the handle makes it convenient to carry around. The bottle is also compatible with other Hydro Flask lids, giving me the option to customize it according to my needs.


One of the things I appreciate most about the Hydro Flask bottle is its ability to keep drinks at the desired temperature for an extended period. Whether I'm enjoying a cold beverage or a hot drink, this bottle maintains the temperature consistently, allowing me to enjoy my drink at my own pace.


Cleaning the bottle is a breeze too. The wide mouth makes it easy to access every nook and cranny, and it's dishwasher safe for added convenience.


Overall, I highly recommend the Hydro Flask Standard Mouth Bottle with Flex Cap. Its durability, insulation capabilities, and user-friendly design make it a top-notch choice for anyone in need of a reliable water bottle. Stay hydrated in style with Hydro Flask!
I recently purchased the Hydro Flask and I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase! This sleek and stylish water bottle not only looks great, but it also delivers exceptional performance. The double-wall vacuum insulation keeps my beverages at the perfect temperature for hours. Whether it's a hot cup of coffee in the morning or a refreshing cold drink in the afternoon, the Hydro Flask maintains the ideal temperature with remarkable consistency.


One of the standout features for me is its durability. The stainless steel construction feels incredibly sturdy, and it has survived a few accidental drops without a scratch. The powder-coated finish not only adds a premium touch but also provides a secure grip, preventing slips even when my hands are wet.


I also appreciate the thoughtful design details. The wide mouth makes it easy to clean and fill, and it's compatible with various accessories like straw lids and coffee flasks, adding versatility to its functionality. The leak-proof design gives me peace of mind, allowing me to toss it in my bag without worrying about spills.


In summary, the Hydro Flask has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance, durability, and style. It's not just a water bottle; it's an investment in quality and a statement of conscious living. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a reliable, stylish, and eco-conscious hydration companion. Cheers to staying hydrated in style!


Hydro flasks sell themselves. This one is like the others; keeps cold things cold and hot things hot. The selling point on this one is its size. This is my go-to water bottle for any traveling as it fits nicely in cup holders and backpack side pockets. It holds a good amount of water without taking up a great deal of space.
I have always bought my daughter the larger bottle, as I assumed it would keep her hydrated throughout her school day. This bottle actually works much better for her as it fits comfortably in her backpack without it making it too heavy. She can refill as the day goes. I think it’s the perfect size for a teen.
Very nice water bottle. This is my second one and the first one is a 32 ounce and I’ve had it for five years and still going strong.
I have always been a fan of this brand and love the color I went with. Very soft and an excellent shade of green.
Solid water bottle that takes the everyday beating of a second grader! We bought the straw lid separately to make it easier to drink from. Fits in a backpack water bottle pocket and stays cold all day.
Nice quality, and handle makes it easy for me to carry the bottle while walking.
Bought it for my daughter to take to school.
She loves it. -thank you.
I HATE drinking water, or anything else for that matter. I have to force myself to drink water and in the past I tried different bottles of various sizes and caps. I would wind up buying 16.9 oz bottled waters at the store because that was the easiest way for me to drink enough water. I finally felt guilty about plastic use and decided to find a bottle I liked. I hate the sippy cup, straws etc. I just want to take a chug of water. I don't like giant bottles, I find I wind up actually drinking less water out of big bottles. This Standard Mouth Bottle with Flex Cap is a perfect size. It fits in my car cup holder and doesn't stand up too high. I drink three a day with ice which is easy to fit in the mouth of the bottle. I use it mostly at home so I don't use the cap very often. I actually lost the cap somewhere in my house and I appreciated that I could buy a replacement.
It is very nice and light weight keeps drinks cold for hours
Love that there’s no straw where gunk and mold gets stuck. Thick and great quality. It will dent when dropped so warm the kids to handle with care to preserve its pretty looks. Recommend for middle and high schoolers
Great water bottle of course! Keeps water cold for hours and good amount of water for a day of activities. Hydro flask for the win always!
Love these cups and really like that they come in all different colors. The other one I have the lid don’t leak. It keep my water cold, and the ice don’t melt. Great price on Amazon.
I only have a class a day so I don't drink a lot of water in class. I bought the 40 oz and 21 oz bottles of this color. Such a pretty color for the flask. I'm just really happy at the compactness that it can fit a fairly small bag.
Love the bottle, daughter loves that stickers actually adhere to it. Good quality holds up to kids dropping it.
I needed a green gift for St.Patrick's Day. This one was a great option, useful, a good price. Good brand that does what it should - keeps cold all day.
Perfectly priced, durable, keeps drinks cold, looks great. Got no complaints
Easy to clean, but also perfect to keep your water cold!! Love the handle also so I can hold it while I’m the gym/ work/school etc. The color I ordered was the purple super duper pretty and doesn’t get dirty easily.
I’ve been a HF fan for years, but was looking for a light weight water bottle for my trip to Egypt this Summer. Luckily my intuition led me away from the plastic insulated bottles at the camping store and right back to the tried and true HF. I chose a smaller 24oz white bottle and bought a silicone boot to protect it from bumps and drops. Turns out it fit into my crossbody sling perfecto and most importantly kept my water COLD while I toured well over 50 archaeological sites over16 days with temps averaging 108 degrees farenheit. I’m grateful that I stuck with a brand that has always worked well for me. And it’s good to know that I’ll get the best price point on Amazon and at Whole Foods. In other words, buy it!
We love these hydro flasks!
Keeps drinks cold for several hours. Love it.
HydoFlasks are great products. My family own five of theses in different sizes and we love them.
I have been wanting to get a bottle that can keep water cool during the hot summer. After seeing a lot of people using Hydro Flask bottles with good reviews. I decided to give it a try. And there we go, I am very satisfied with it. I like how there is a handle on the cap, so I can carry it around easily. I have been using it for a month now, I basically carry it with me everywhere, to work, to gym, or even bringing it with me when I bike.
The packaging is nice and neat, and the cap has "insulated" and "BPA free" and a cute little logo printed on it. No leakage at all if you close the cap tightly.
I bought it in white, so the concern is that it will get stains or dirt on it easily. So far, there has been no such problem, and I clean it very often. I am excited to use it when the winter comes, I believe it can keep my water warm in the cold weather.
As a title explains, it keeps water cold for a long amount of time. Bought it for my niece who uses it every day at school and by the time she gets home if there’s any liquid left in the bottle, it is still cold, which is obviously a great indication of the quality build being good
Highly recommend love this! Get many compliments on color. Easy to Carry, clean, keeps cold for 2 days with ice!! Beautiful color !
Great sized water bottle from HydroFlask. Perfect for traveling or taking with you since it's not too big or too heavy. Water stays cold for 12 hours and doesn't leak at all. Love all the color options.
I got this as a gift for my sister. perfect size to carry in your purse for bag. she loves the bright white color. keeps her water cold for a long time. would buy more.
Lasts so long and keeps water cold forever. This is third one I have and send them to school with my kids.
This does a great job keeping fluids cold for hours. Slim design fits in cupholder.
I first recieved a dented one but then it got replaced very fast with a new in the box one. I assume it was a returned item at first. Been using it a few weeks, no problems.
Its cute and it works. I mean its a hydro. Your drink will stay cold for HOURS which I love cuz I love my water cold. Also cute if you put stickers which I have not done but will do soon hopefully.
I got this for my boyfriend as a gift and he loves it
I use this for hot tea or ice tea. 32 oz
is a great size and I prefer lid rather than straw. Tight lid, no leaking. Keeps cold or hot as needed for a long time.
Best water thermal insulated bottle of all time... Perfect color | Lid | Comfort | Ease of cleaning |
Temperature | Handle
Keeps water cold. Washes easily. I usually wash by hand. You have to unscrew the top to drink from it like a cup. But the simplicity means less features to break as happened to my old, different bottle.
Primarily using this as a water bottle. It fits well in my hand and in my car’s cup holders. I don’t mind unscrewing the cap and I think it makes for easier cleaning to not have some kind of spout- type cap. Keeps the water cold overnight, maybe longer.
I bought this for a second time after my first one was to dented to be carried everyday with me. I dropped it from a foot high and it dented even with a rubber butt on it. Still an amazing water bottle and would recommend to most
Great color. My daughter loves it and instantly covered it with a hundred stickers. The handle is strong, the bottle is durable, and does not leak. Highly recommend.
I wanted to buy a water bottle that I could pack in a carry on bag or my work bag without leaking. This bottle is perfect. I just returned from a trip where I brought it everywhere with no leaks. I also like the smooth mouth of the bottle. It has no ridges for screwing on the cap, and it's very comfortable to drink from.
Cold water will stay cold for around 24/36 hours
keeps the temperature consist throughout the whole day
Very stylish does not leak. Great if you are a student. Washing it is easy as well.
 NICE SIZE. VERY PRETTY COLOR. PRETTY CUTE. GOOD TO HOLD. I LIKE THAT IT DOESN'T COME WITH A STRAW OPENING BC IT WILL BE EASIER AND FASTER TO CLEAN. ORDERED IT FOR WORK SO THAT I CAN HAVE COLD WATER READY AND AVAILABLE.
This flask is great. I like to add tons of ice to my flask and refill throughout the day. My water stays cold even by the end of my shift and there's even some ice still floating around. I got the 21oz in purple (very cute color btw).
It's better for warm drinks.
Very attractive. High quality.
I couldn't freeze my water like regular water bottles.
BETTER VALUE THAN MOST STORES, FEELS GREAT TO TOUCH, KEEPS FLUIDS COLD FOR A LONG TIME
I love how this flask stays SUPER cold for hours! Help me maintain my water intake.
I purchase this bottle because it has good insulation and keeps your water cool at hot summer days. Additionally on trips you can place it on most car cup holders without any issues.
Daughter uses for school. Still has ice once she gets home. A little heavy.
BEST water bottle out there! Keeps ice for over 24 hours without melting! Love it!
Was looking for a smaller hydroflask to take to a music festival that would weigh too much when filled with water. This ended up being the perfect size and not heavy at all, was easy to carry around all day. The color is so cute too!
I like that this particular water bottle is tall and slender, which makes it easier to fit in my purse or my backpack, especially in outside side pockets for water bottles. I have used it on two weeklong trips, and it has kept my water cold and my tea extremely hot. I recommend letting your tea cool down a bit before placing in the Hydro Flask because it will stay extremely hot a really long time. The lid seals the container well, so I have not had any problems with leaking. The color I chose is still holding up even though I’ve dropped it a couple of times already. So far, I recommend this type of bottle.
